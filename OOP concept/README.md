## What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a coding approach centered on objects, which are like self-contained units combining data (attributes or properties) and actions (methods or functions). In simpler terms, it's about mimicking real-world entities as objects in software, making code modular, organized, and easier to extend

There are four main principles or concepts that form the foundation of OOP:

 Inheritance: Inheritance enables objects to inherit properties and methods from parent objects, establishing a hierarchy with shared characteristics. It fosters code reuse and diminishes  redundancy by facilitating the inheritance of common properties and methods from higher-level objects.

 Encapsulation: This concept involves bundling data and behavior within objects, and hiding the internal details of objects from the outside world. Objects encapsulate their data and methods, 
 which can only be accessed through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation helps to achieve data privacy, code organization, and separation of concerns.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism simplifies code by treating different objects as the same. It provides a unified way to interact with objects, allowing easy substitution of one object with another, as long as they share the same interface. This flexibility makes the code more readable and adaptable, allowing for the smooth integration of new objects without disrupting existing functionality. 

Psuedoclassical inheritance is similar to prototypal inheritance. This type of inheritance emulates classical inheritance using prototypal inheritance. However, if you’re programming with ES6, the use of pseudo-classical inheritance isn’t encouraged since you can use conventional classes (the class keyword). In pseudo-classical inheritance, we try to create a class with a function intended to be called with the new keyword.

Prototypal inheritance is a type of inheritance that adds new properties and methods to an existing object. This inheritance makes use of prototype objects 

Abstraction: Abstraction simplifies complex systems by creating abstract classes or interfaces. These define common properties and methods without giving implementation details. It helps in defining common characteristics and behaviors for objects, which can be implemented differently in various objects

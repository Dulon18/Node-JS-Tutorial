# Node-JS-Tutorial for Beginner
Node.js is an open-source server environment.  Node.js allows you to run
JavaScript on the server.

What Can Node.js Do?

  Node.js can generate dynamic page content
  
  Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
  
  Node.js can collect form data
  
  Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

  
  # Features of Node.js:

Asynchronous and Event Driven − All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.

Very Fast − Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable − Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single-threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.

No Buffering − Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
Asynchronous and Event-Driven: The Node.js library’s APIs are all asynchronous (non-blocking) in nature. A server built with Node.JS never waits for data from an API. from an API. After accessing an API, the server moves on to the next one. In order to receive and track responses of previous API requests, it uses a notification mechanism called Events.

## What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a coding approach centered on objects, which are like self-contained units combining data (attributes or properties) and actions (methods or functions). In simpler terms, it's about mimicking real-world entities as objects in software, making code modular, organized, and easier to extend

There are four main principles or concepts that form the foundation of OOP:

 Encapsulation: This concept involves bundling data and behavior within objects, and hiding the internal details of objects from the outside world. Objects encapsulate their data and methods, 
 which can only be accessed through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation helps to achieve data privacy, code organization, and separation of concerns.

 Inheritance: Inheritance enables objects to inherit properties and methods from parent objects, establishing a hierarchy with shared characteristics. It fosters code reuse and diminishes  redundancy by facilitating the inheritance of common properties and methods from higher-level objects.

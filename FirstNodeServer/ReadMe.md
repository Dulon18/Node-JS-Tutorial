A Node.js application consists of the following three essential components −

1. Import required modules − We use the require directive to load Node.js modules.
2. Create server − A server that will listen to client's requests similar to Apache HTTP Server.
3. Read request and return response − The server created in an earlier step will read the HTTP request made by the client which can be a browser or a console and return the response.

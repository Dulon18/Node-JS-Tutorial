 Most of the basics of handling HTTP requests :

  1. Instantiate an HTTP server with a request handler function, and have it listen on a port.
  2. Get headers, URLs, methods, and body data from request objects.
  3. Make routing decisions based on URL and/or other data in request objects.
  4. Send headers, HTTP status codes, and body data via response objects.
  5. Pipe data from request objects and to response objects.
  6. Handle stream errors in both the request and response streams.
